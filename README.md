# Simple collaborative piano made using Functional Reactive Programming

To learn more about functional reactive programming, I started
making a simple collaborative piano using JavaScript/CoffeeScript. 
I wrote a blog post to show how Functional Reactive Programming can make the 
task of taking multiple event inputs and merging them into one discrete 
sequence of interactions really easy â€“ a task that could otherwise be 
potentially complex and very unstructured/hard to read.
